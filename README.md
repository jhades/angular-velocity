####Design principles:

-  Simple - Just a set of angular directives - Angular + Yahoo PureCss + lodash
- Modular - take only the components you need
- Pattern Based - provides a set of widely used UI Patterns 
- User Friendly - opinionated in terms of look and feel and UX 
- Mobile - allows using the same team for building desktop and mobile form-based apps

####Running it:
